## 📖 Repository Description

The Indian-ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) system is a research-driven project that combines Computer Vision, Database Systems, and Real-Time Notifications to automate vehicle compliance verification in the Indian context. Using  OCR (Optical Character Recognition) - pytesseract for license plate detection and recognition, the system extracts vehicle numbers from images and validates them against a MySQL registration database.

To enhance usability, the project integrates with Twilio, allowing authorities to track which users are registered and which are not through automated SMS notifications. This work demonstrates a practical application of AI and software engineering by bridging image processing, backend database design, and cloud-based communication APIs.

The project not only strengthened my expertise in AI frameworks and Python development, but also highlighted the role of integrated intelligent systems in real-world societal applications such as traffic enforcement and smart city solutions.

## 📂 Project Overview  

- 🚘 Developed a **vehicle details verification system** powered by **Computer Vision + Database Integration**.  
- 📸 Implemented a pipeline for **license plate detection & number extraction** from vehicle images.  
- 🔎 Connected extracted data with a **registration database** to validate:  
  - ✅ Owner details  
  - ✅ Vehicle model  
  - ✅ Registration/document validity  
- ⚠️ Built automated **alerts for expired or invalid registrations**.  
- 📲 Integrated **Twilio SMS notifications** to track which users are registered and which are not — enabling real-time compliance monitoring.
