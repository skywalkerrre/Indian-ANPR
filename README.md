ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) and Vehicle Details Checking System is a technological solution that provides an efficient and automated way to identify and track vehicles. The system works by capturing the number plates of vehicles using cameras and then running the images through an algorithm that extracts the plate number. This information is then cross-referenced with a database of registered vehicles to retrieve detailed information about the vehicle, including the make, model, owner's details, and registration status.
The extracted data is then compared with the database to check for the validity of the documents of the respective user. If it turns out to be invalid, a message prompt is given to the user which states that his documents are not up to date and he has to renew it. This system is very useful in ensuring the proper functioning of traffic and security systems.

Deployment
The system is deployed in the local machine with dependencies like MySQL database which is also deployed in the local machine. It can be accessed by this link “ http://localhost:3000/admin ”.
